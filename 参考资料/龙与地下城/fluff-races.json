								"他们的身体披覆着羽毛。他们全身鸟羽的样式通常代表着他们所属的部落。男性个体的羽色较为鲜艳，通常为红色、橘色、或黄色。女性则有着较为柔和的羽色，通常为棕色或灰色。他们的头部完全就是鸟禽的外貌，如同鹦鹉或是鹰隼，且根据部落不同而有明显差异。"

								"没有别处比天空更能让阿兰寇拉鹰人感到自在。他们可以在空中待上数个小时、而有些甚至会在空中长达数天，伸展它们的双翼以让上升气流带着他们翺翔天际。在战斗中，他们会展现出灵动自如的飞行体操，以惊人的速度和优雅穿梭，向着敌人俯冲降下武器或禽爪，在迅速回转并飞掠远去。",
								"一旦展翅飞翔，阿兰寇拉鹰人便不怎么愿意再离开天空。在他们的原生位面，他们可以持续飞行数天或甚至数个月，且只会在产卵和喂养幼崽时才会降落地面，并随之迅速回到空中。那些来到物质位面世界中的阿兰寇拉鹰人都觉得这里是个奇怪的地方。他们有时候会忘记或忽略垂直高度的距离影响，且他们对那些被迫束缚于地面生活劳作的人们只有满满的同情。"

								"许多阿兰寇拉鹰人都会在他们说话时以啾啾声强调重点并加深语意，其作用与人类的面部表情和肢体动作类似。一名阿兰寇拉鹰人可能会对那些无法分辨其中差异的人们感到沮丧；阿兰寇拉鹰人的出言威胁也可能因此被当作开玩笑，反之亦然。",

								"也因此，那些很少与其他人交流的阿兰寇拉鹰人很可能会被当作讨厌鬼，尤其是当他们从空中飞下带走牲畜、或当他们掠夺那些丰收的果实和谷物时更为如此。闪闪发亮的物体总能吸引他们的目光。他们很难抗拒收获财宝，并将之带回去美化据点的欲望。不过，那些与其他种族生活数年之久的阿兰寇拉鹰人多多少少学会了抑制这种冲动。",
								"阿兰寇拉鹰人惧怕受到监禁。被束缚在地面、困在地下、或囚禁在冰冷坚硬的大地中，对阿兰寇拉鹰人来说都是难以忍受的折磨。即使当他们停歇在高处枝头、或在他们山巅的家园中休息，他们也都会保持警觉，四处张望并随时准备起身高飞。"

								"另外两种状况也可能会使阿兰寇拉鹰人出发冒险。第一，阿兰寇拉鹰人与艾夸的风之公爵一族有着历史性的深刻渊源。一些杰出的个体会以这种联系为荣，并可能会寻找七节权杖(Rod of Seven Parts)的遗失残骸。这把由风之公爵一族所塑造的神器在久远以前曾被用以击败混沌之后(Queen of Chaos)的怪物拥护者：狼蛛密斯卡(Miska the Wolf-Spider)。",
								"当这把权杖被插进密斯卡的躯体时，牠血液中的混沌切裂了这把权杖，并将它的碎片散落在多元宇宙中。收复这些碎片，意味着从打造了权杖的瓦蒂一族(vaati)中赢得荣誉和敬重，同时也可能借此恢复一把将用于抵抗邪恶元素势力的强大武器。",
								"第二，阿兰寇拉鹰人将土元素生物视为死敌，特别是那些侍奉于土之亲王欧雷莫奇(Ogremoch, the Prince of Earth)的石像鬼。阿兰寇拉鹰人的语言中对于这些石像鬼的称呼可以被笼统翻译作「飞行岩块」，阿兰寇拉鹰人与石像鬼之间的战争爆发在土元素位面和气元素位面，且偶尔会蔓延到物质位面的世界中。在这个位面的阿兰寇拉鹰人可能会离开他们的聚落，并帮助其他类人生物以对抗土之邪教徒，并阻挠他们的阴谋。"

That disagreement quickly flared into open hostility, and the two groups distanced themselves from one another to pursue their separate agendas.

Ranging out from the titanic city of Tu'narath on the Astral Plane, they send raiders out to plunder the Material Plane and other worlds, bringing treasures and slaves back to their ageless realm. At the same time, they hunt down and kill mind flayers whenever possible, as recompense for what the illithids did to them.",
						"The githzerai believed that the path to an enlightened civilization lay in seclusion, not conflict. Their dedication to the principles of order is so strong that they can manipulate the stuff of chaos and use it to their benefit; thus, they have carved out a stronghold for themselves on the plane of Limbo that is virtually impervious. Though the githzerai are pacifists by nature, they share the githyanki's racial hatred for mind flayers, and from time to time they send out squads to destroy illithid outposts.",
						"If the two races were ever to team up against the illithids, a combined force of gith could conceivably tip the balance in their favor.
